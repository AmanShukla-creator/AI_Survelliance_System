# 🚨 AI Surveillance System (AGES)

An intelligent real-time AI-powered surveillance system that uses computer vision and deep learning to monitor live video feeds, detect suspicious activities, recognize SOS hand gestures, and trigger alerts automatically.

Designed for public safety, smart surveillance, and emergency response systems.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Traditional surveillance systems:

- Only record footage
- Require manual monitoring
- Fail to detect emergencies in real time

AGES solves this by adding AI-based intelligence to live surveillance feeds.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

AGES integrates:

- YOLO for real-time object detection
- MediaPipe for hand gesture and SOS recognition
- OpenCV for camera access and frame processing
- Backend APIs for alert handling
- Frontend dashboard for visualization

The system detects abnormal events and raises alerts without human intervention.
